Module 'translation_model_interface.py' is added.

Each class of translator model (currently we have only one such class) should be inherited from this interface. It contains three methods:

* 'make_initial_state'
    Accepts array of lines.
    Returns initial translation state for lines.

* 'get_next_state_and_logits'
    Accepts current translation state and model outputs.
    Returns next translation state and logits.

* 'get_output_vocabulary'
    Return output vocabulary used in model.
